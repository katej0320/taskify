## 💻 My Contributions – *Jang Bobae (Team Lead) 👑*

- Implemented user authentication features including **login, logout, and sign-up** using **JWT tokens**, stored in `localStorage` and applied through **Axios interceptors** for secure API requests.
- Built **profile image upload and delete** functionality on My Page using **`FormData`** to handle `File` objects and **dynamically updated preview URLs** to reflect changes immediately.
- Developed **password change feature** with proper input validation, current password verification, and secure update logic to protect user credentials.
- Enhanced landing page UX with **scroll animations (AOS)** and **typing effects (TypeAnimation)**, synchronizing animations using `useEffect` lifecycle management.
- Led the project as **Team Lead**, organizing **GitHub branch workflows**, conducting **pull request reviews**, and managing **feature integration** and collaboration across the team.
